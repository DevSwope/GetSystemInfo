# GetSystemInfo (Visual Basic)
I made this app as a project in my free time to be able to send a link via email to the executable that will be stored on a network share
so the end-user can either copy/paste the info or send a screenshot back to us with useful information regarding their PC. This file 
was mainly to practive an hone the skills I have learned so far watching Visual Basic and Python courses on Udemy and LinkedIn Learning.
I built this application for use at Samtec, Inc. but it can be rebranded and used pretty much anywhere, as long as .NET is installed in Windows.
